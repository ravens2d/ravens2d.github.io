        <h2>what and why?</h2>

        <p>
            I started sketching a peer to peer chat protocol, yuzu. my thesis is
            that it's possible to build a protocol that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                allows for permissionless network participation, with no central
                host or authority
            </li>
            <li>
                supports
                <a
                    href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >local first semantics</a
                >, like offline use and eventually consistent data sync
            </li>
            <li>
                provides a reasonable access control and capabilities system
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>functional structure</h2>

        <p>from a user perspective, yuzu behaves as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <u>users</u> may join any number of <u>groups</u> (akin to
                "servers" in discord), which contain any number of
                <u>channels</u>
            </li>
            <li>
                users send <u>messages</u> to a channel, which are eventually
                delivered to all users in a group
            </li>
            <li>
                groups are <u>owned</u> by an originating user, and group owners
                may grant any number of <u>capabilities</u> to users in their
                groups, which includes invites to join and moderation abilities
            </li>
            <li>
                anyone may join the global network, allowing them to discover
                (in the network sense) and join clusters of peers
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>protocol sketch</h2>

        <p>functionally, yuzu is based on the following primitives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/" target="_blank">ed25519</a>

                and verify message authorship via signatures
            </li>
            <li>
                ephemeral <a href="" target="_blank">x25519</a> key pairs for
                peer to peer encryption

        <h3>identity</h3>

        <p>
            identity in yuzu is straightforward if you're familiar with other
            p2p networks. each peer generates a long term ed25519 public/private
            key pair. a peer is identified, both within the network and in terms
            of content authorship, by their public key.
        </p>

        <p>
            when two peers connect, they generate ephemeral x25519 key pairs for
            encryption (signed by their ed25519 keys for proof of identity).
            these are used in a
            <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange"
                target="_blank"
                >diffie-hellman exchange</a
            >, after which a
            <a

            >
            secret is used for symmetric encryption.
        </p>

        <h3>hash graphs</h3>

        <p>
            hash graphs are the means for providing a causal ordering over
            events within yuzu.
        </p>

        <p>each entry in a hash graph has the following structure:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-go">
type Entry struct {
    ID hash.Hash // sha256(EntryData, signature)
    EntryData
    Signature []byte // sign(sha256(EntryData), signer_private_key)
}

type EntryData struct {
    Previous    []hash.Hash
    Sequence    uint64 // per pubkey incrementing id
    Content     []byte
    CreatedAt   uint64 // unix timestamp of entry creation
    Author      ed25519.PublicKey
}
    </code></pre>

        <p>
            note that each entry may point to multiple previous entires in the
            graph. entries that point to more than one parent are effectively
            performing a "merge operation" of log state within the topological
            ordering.
        </p>

        <p>
            ordering is defined by a deterministic topological sort over the
            graph, with ties broken by alphabetical sorting the entry hashes.
        </p>

        <img src="hashgraph.png" style="max-width: ch; width: 100%" />

        <h3>group design</h3>

        <p>
            groups in yuzu are defined by a central, per group "operation" hash
            graph that is permanent and used for capabilities management, access
            control, and CRUD operations over channels.
        </p>

        <p>
            the operation graph is initialized by a user with a message as
            follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">
{
    "type": "OPERATION_CREATE_GROUP",
    "group_metadata": {
        "title": "My cool group",
        "description": "A group for my friends to chat together"
    }
}
    </code></pre>

        <p>
            an OPERATION_CREATE_GROUP operation will have no Previous entry
            defined. the ID (hash) of this entry will also be used as the
            GroupID from now on, uniquely identifying each group.
        </p>

        <p>
            the group owner may then create new entries in the operation graph
            to grant or revoke <u>capabilities</u>, create <u>channels</u>, and
            update metadata.
        </p>

        <h3>capabilities and pseudo-finality</h3>

        <p>
            for example, "inviting" another user to the group can be achieved
            via the JOIN capability.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">
{
    "type": "OPERATION_GRANT_CAPABILITY",
    "capability_data": {
        "type": "JOIN",
        "granter": "/UVrV7KeYPM18mwy6RzlOFe/khd0QRq5vGsTu/LU758=",
        "grantee": "y2UmRYuNtib7zR4USNlTUExL2ic3RXXh70ezlEtol7E=",
        "valid_from": 1717278799,
        "valid_until": 1717909333
    }
}
    </code></pre>

        <p>
            note the use of <u>unix timestamps</u> for bounding the use of this
            operation. this is obviously not a perfect solution given the
            dynamics of peer to peer systems, as authors could attempt to use a
            capability that was revoked or expired by manufacturing a new entry
            with a timestamp and causal dependency set "backwards in time". this
            is not distinguishable from legitimate but stale messages due to
            network availability and offline data sync.
        </p>

        <p>
            to mitigate this, we tweak the availability and consistency
            expectations specifically for the operation DAG, where nodes define
            an acceptance boundary for new entires in terms of the claimed
            timestamp and the node's current clocktime. to allow for historic
            sync, we also define alternative validity under "depth of
            attestations" (previous links from other peers).
        </p>

        <img src="finality.png" style="max-width: ch; width: 100%" />

        <p>
            attestations of entry validity (that they are non-byzantine, aka
            received within a timely window) may be explicitly entered into the
            DAG, but they may also be implicit via subsequent operations
            treating these operations as a dependency (ancestor of one of their
            own entries).
        </p>

        <p>
            while not a perfect solution, I posit that this pseudo-finality
            strikes a reasonable tradeoff between byzantine protection, offline
            sync, and no required strong consensus mechanism.
        </p>

        <p>
            the following parameters may be made tunable per group or per
            implementation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                the amount a new entry's timestamp is allowed to deviate from
                node clock time before it's considered invalid by peers,
                referred to as <u>skew tolerance</u>
            </li>
            <li>
                the number of identities attesting to the validity of a message
                required for it to be considered valid, referred to as the
                <u>attestation threshold</u>
            </li>
            <li>
                the conditions under which nodes explicitly attest vs depend on
                implicit attestation
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>for a flagship implementation, I propose the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                owner entries require no attestations, they are automatically
                assumed valid
            </li>
            <li>
                owner always attests explicitly, other peers have a probability
                to attest based on the number of observed live peers
            </li>
            <li>owner attestations carry more weight than non-owner ones</li>
        </ul>
